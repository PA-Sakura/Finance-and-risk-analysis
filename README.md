## INFERENCES AFTER ANALYSING THE DATA
As I found out that 8 stocks gave more than 80% in the last five years of the stock market. The stocks that give the best return among all stocks are AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, FB, UNH, GOOG, MS, and S&P500. Each stock has different risks and liabilities according to its Annualized risk, Sharpe ratio. I found out that AMZN gives the highest return among all stocks but has a high risk as compared to other stocks. We also found that stocks like JNJ, RHHBY, MRK, and MSFT have good returns with less risk. So after doing all the analysis, we have finalized the portfolio for both the customers.

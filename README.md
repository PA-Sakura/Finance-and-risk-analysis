EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:

Checked for the outliers in the dataset.

DATA ANALYSIS:
Analysed the stock data using different calculation like daily returns, cumulative daily return, Sharpe ratio, Portfolio risk and Return on investment(ROI).
Found best suitable stocks for all portfolios.

INFERENCES AFTER ANALYSING THE DATA:
As I found out that there are 8 stocks which gives more than 80% in last five years of stock market. The stocks that gives best return among all stocks are AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, FB, UNH, GOOG, MS, S&P500. Each stock has different risk and liability according to its Annualized risk, Sharpe ratio. I found out that AMZN gives highest return among all stock but has high risk as compared to other stocks. We also found that stocks like JNJ, RHHBY, MRK and MSFT have good returns with less risk. So after doing all the analysis we have finalized the portfolio for both the customers.
